SnapDiff V3 application for Linux
-----------------------------------

Usage:
-----

This application implements snapdiff v3 APIs.

The usage of the application is as follows:

USAGE: ./sdv3-client -f <VSERVERIP> -h <SESSION_HANDLE> -i <SESSION_ID>

			VSERVERIP: Vserver Data IP address.
			SESSION_HANDLE, SESSION_ID: Please refer in snapdiff V3 API documentation
			on how to invoke REST API "POST /storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/snapdiff/sessions"
			and get SESSION_HANDLE and SESSION_ID.


Compilation:
-----------

Run "make" in /src/sample/Data_ONTAP/C/sdv3 directory to compile the application.
This should generate sdv3-client under the same location.

Set $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to <head_dir>/sdk-staging/lib/linux-64 before compilng the application.

Dependencies:
------------

sdv3-client expects the following libraries in the <head_dir>/sdk-staging/lib/linux-64 path.

libadt.a
libadt.so
libcrypto.so
libnetapp.a
libnetapp.so
libsdv3.a
libsdv3.so
libssl.so
libxml.so


SnapDiff V3 application for Windows
-----------------------------------

Usage:
-----

The usage of the Windows application is as follows:

USAGE: sdv3_client_for_windows.exe -f <VSERVERIP> -h <SESSION_HANDLE> -i <SESSION_ID>

			VSERVERIP: Vserver Data IP address.
			SESSION_HANDLE, SESSION_ID: Please refer in snapdiff V3 API documentation
			on how to invoke REST API "POST /storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/snapdiff/sessions"
			and get SESSION_HANDLE and SESSION_ID.


Compilation:
-----------

Use sdv3_client_for_windows.vcxproj to compile the application. This should generate
sdv3_client_for_windows.exe in a new /Debug or /Release directory, depending on
whether Debug or Release version is being built.

Follow the below steps to build this sample application on windows:

1. Open <Extracted_NMSDK_ZIP>/src/sample/Data_ONTAP/C/sdv3/client_windows/sdv3_client_for_windows.vcxproj file in Visual Studio 2015.
2. Download 'oncrpc' from https://sourceforge.net/projects/oncrpc-windows/ URL and extract it.
3. Make the following changes in sdv3_client_for_windows.vcxproj file:
    3.1. Right click on sdv3_client_for_windows project in Solution Explorer
    3.2. Click on Properties. This should open up the properties for a particular configuration type (like Release x86 for instance).
    3.3. In the Properties window, select C/C++ ----> General section on the left pane
    3.4. Then under "Additional Include Directories", add the path to the oncrpc /include directory. To do this, replace "[ONCRPC_ROOT_DIR_PATH]" with the path to the extracted oncrpc root directory (from step-3 above). Repeat this step for all configuration types: Debug/Release - x86 (aka Win32)/x64.
         For example: If oncrpc is extracted into "C:\oncrpc" directory, then the complete path to the /include directory you should see after replacing "[ONCRPC_ROOT_DIR_PATH]", will be "C:\oncrpc\win32\include" in the sdv3_client_for_windows.vcxproj file.
    3.5  Click on "Apply" and then "OK".
4. Download getopt.h and getopt.c from https://github.com/alex85k/wingetopt URL and extract it, say into C:/wingetopt-master/ for instance.
    4.1  Copy getopt.h and getopt.c files from C:/wingetopt-master/src/, to <Extracted_NMSDK_ZIP>/src/sample/Data_ONTAP/C/sdv3/client_windows/include and <Extracted_NMSDK_ZIP>/src/sample/Data_ONTAP/C/sdv3/client_windows respectively.
    4.2  You might have to comment out line# 348:
            (posixly_correct = (getenv("POSIXLY_CORRECT") != NULL))
         in getopt.c, because there is a deprecation error for getenv() method.
5. Right cick on sdv3_client_for_windows project once again, and click on "Build". If build is successful, the corresponding .exe file will be generated.
   Note: For subsequent builds after making any changes to the project, you need to click on "Rebuild" instead of "Build" above.


Dependencies:
------------

sdv3_client_for_windows.exe expects the following *.dll files in the DLL search path
of the application. Make sure you copy these into the appropriate /Debug or /Release
directory which contains the .exe file.

libsdv3.dll (or) libsdv3d.dll, depending on whether it is Release or Debug configuration.
oncrpc.dll
libeay32.dll
ssleay32.dll

i) These oncrpc.dll files can be generated using the below steps:
    A) Download oncrpc zip from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/oncrpc-windows/ and extract it.
	B) Now navigate to oncrpc_win32_release_2\oncrpc\win32\librpc\lib and open oncrpc.dsp file in Visual Studio (I have used Visual Studio 2015 Professional)
	C) Then build for flavors like Debug - x86 & Release - x86, and copy oncrpc.dll from Debug and Release folder to a separate location.
	D) Add x64 to Solution Platforms of Configuration Manager, by default only x86 is available.
	E) Then build for flavors like Debug x64 & Release - x64, and copy oncrpc.dll from Debug and Release folder to a separate location.

ii) You must ensure that the libeay32 and ssleay32 dynamic binaries(DLLs) are present in NetApp Manageability SDK zip(i.e. <Extracted_NMSDK_ZIP>) at lib/nt/ and lib/nt/x64 locations respectively.
